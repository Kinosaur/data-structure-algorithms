Question - 1:
Construst Binary Search Tree with input and trturn the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two nodes in the tree. Write a Python 3 program to complete this task.
# n elements are separated by white space, non repeated integer whose possible value is in [0, 100]
# output is hte minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
# Exmaple, input - 36 54 44 70 94 75 86 99, output - 5
# Exmaple, input - 27 60 74 52 63 56 85, output - 3

Use the Kuskal Algorithm, I gave u.
The sample is image of graph. so we need to make .in file ourself seeing graph. In the .in file, the first line will the total number of vertices and Under will be the edge list like in this example:
10
0, 1, 10
0, 2, 4
0, 3, 5
1, 3, 13
1, 5, 7
2, 3, 2
2, 4, 16
2, 8, 18
3, 4, 9
3, 5, 14
3, 7, 3
4, 7, 20
4, 8, 1
4, 9, 15
5, 7, 8
5, 6, 6
