### Answer 3: What is the table size you use for the provided test case? Why?

- Table Size: 10
- Justification:
  1. Load Factor: With 10 keys and a table size of 10, the load factor is 10/10 = 1.0, which ensures efficient distribution and minimizes collisions.
  2. Collision Management: The size provides enough buckets to handle collisions effectively with separate chaining.
  3. Balanced Performance: Larger sizes would waste memory, and smaller sizes (e.g., 9) would increase collisions and degrade performance. 

Thus, a table size of 10 is optimal for balancing efficiency and memory usage in this test case.
