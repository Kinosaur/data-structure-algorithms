# Data Structure & Algorithms — University Coursework

This repository contains materials and code for my university Data Structure & Algorithms course. The organization reflects a weekly progression through the curriculum, with additional folders for midterm and final exam preparations. The code spans multiple languages (primarily JavaScript and Python) to match course requirements and personal exploration.

## Structure

- **Weekly Folders** (`Week1`, `Week2`, ...):  
  Each folder corresponds to a week of the course, containing lecture notes, assignments, and coding exercises. Expect a mix of solved problems, sample algorithms, and occasional pseudocode.

- **Exams**  
  - `Midterm/`: Contains my midterm exam solutions and preparation notes.
  - `Final/`: Contains my final exam solutions, study guides, and any relevant review material.

## Contents

- **Programming Languages:** 
  - Python (for assignments and algorithmic exploration)
  - Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive experimentation and explanatios)

- **Topics Covered:**  
  - Fundamental data structures (arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables)
  - Core algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy methods)
  - Complexity analysis (Big O notation, time/space trade-offs)
  - Exam-specific problems and solutions

## Usage

This repository is primarily an archive and reference for my own learning, but others studying data structures and algorithms may find the progression and solved exercises useful. The code is not optimized for production, and may reflect the iterative process of learning — including mistakes, corrections, and alternative approaches.

### How to Navigate

- Start with the earliest week to see foundational concepts.
- Progress through each folder chronologically for a sense of how topics build.
- Use the `Midterm` and `Final` folders for condensed reviews or exam-style problems.

## License & Academic Integrity

All code and materials are my own work, submitted for university assignments. If you're a fellow student, use this repository for reference only — do not submit any material as your own.

## Suggestions and Critique

If you spot errors, questionable approaches, or have alternative solutions, open an issue or pull request. Constructive criticism is valued, especially if you challenge assumptions or propose more efficient algorithms.
